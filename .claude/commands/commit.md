# Git Commit : Well Formatted Commits

This command helps you create well-formatted commits with conventional commit messages and emoji.

## Usage

To create a commit, just type:
```
/commit
```

Or with options:
```
/commit --no-verify
```

## What This Command Does

1. Unless specified with `--no-verify`, ALWAYS runs pre-commit checks:
    - any possible linting to ensure code quality
    - any possible build to verify the build succeeds
    - any possible documentation generation to update documentation
2. Checks which files are staged with `git status`
3. Automatically adds all modified and new files with `git add`
4. Performs a `git diff` to understand what changes are being committed
5. Analyzes the diff to determine if multiple distinct logical changes are present
6. Creates a commit message using emoji conventional commit format

## Best Practices for Commits

- **Verify before committing**: Ensure code is linted, builds correctly, and documentation is updated. Make sure to run ALL of the pre-commit checks first.
- **Atomic commits**: Each commit should contain related changes that serve a single purpose
- **Split large changes**: If changes touch multiple concerns, split them into separate commits
- **Conventional commit format**: Use the format `<type>: <description>` where type is one of:
    - `feat`: A new feature
    - `fix`: A bug fix
    - `docs`: Documentation changes
    - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc)
    - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
    - `perf`: Performance improvements
    - `test`: Adding or fixing tests
    - `chore`: Changes to the build process, tools, etc.
- **Present tense, imperative mood**: Write commit messages as commands (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature")
- **Concise first line**: Keep the first line under 72 characters
- **Emoji**: Each commit type is paired with an appropriate emoji:
    - ✨ `feat`: New feature
    - 🐛 `fix`: Bug fix
    - 📝 `docs`: Documentation
    - 💄 `style`: Formatting/style
    - ♻️ `refactor`: Code refactoring
    - ⚡️ `perf`: Performance improvements
    - ✅ `test`: Tests
    - 🔧 `chore`: Tooling, configuration
    - 🚀 `ci`: CI/CD improvements
    - 🗑️ `revert`: Reverting changes
    - 🧪 `test`: Add a failing test
    - 🚨 `fix`: Fix compiler/linter warnings
    - 🔒️ `fix`: Fix security issues
    - 👥 `chore`: Add or update contributors
    - 🚚 `refactor`: Move or rename resources
    - 🏗️ `refactor`: Make architectural changes
    - 🔀 `chore`: Merge branches
    - 📦️ `chore`: Add or update compiled files or packages
    - ➕ `chore`: Add a dependency
    - ➖ `chore`: Remove a dependency
    - 🌱 `chore`: Add or update seed files
    - 🧑‍💻 `chore`: Improve developer experience
    - 🧵 `feat`: Add or update code related to multithreading or concurrency
